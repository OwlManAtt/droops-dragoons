        - But she's ugly
        - So they don't let her out
            - Literally, elf queen put her in a coma.

    - Prince of Shadows wants the ugly princess for an end-of-age ritual
        - Entilzha: "....ah."

    - The icons conduct a ritual, betting on what races/powers will be important in the next age
        - Decides the fate of all the races
        - Ex: In this age, no tieflings left & no living machines
        - They decided this last age

    - Ritual happens in the Queen's Wood
        - this is why elves are consitently one of the three major powers
        - Turai asks why it happens here
            - Place of power
            - Everyone thinks it needs to be here
            - Queen is OK with this

    - Elf queen accidentally made the orcs
    
    - She mentions zorigami
        - We al cough

    - Archmage put the zorigami into play
        - They would signal to the other icons when it was time for the ritual
        - Near the end of the age

    - Zorigami are crucial to the ritual
        - Representing a living machine race, which can make them more powerful in next age
        - Alt: one race always gets screwed, gets sacrified for the others

    - "Your majesty, may I present for your pleasure ..."
    - Pulls back the blanket in the stroller, egg hops up and toots

    - Elf Queen notices Solon
        - "You brought me the egg!"
    - Queen had dispatched Solon to destroy the Zorigami
    - Solon is fuckin pissed at her
    - Solon will not destroy the egg

    - Solon: "I learned much from the diabolist..."

    - The Elf Queen is surprised when Solon says he died for her
        - "I understand. That explains a lot."
        - She fixes his memory.

- Princess gave us some tea
    - We get kinda high
    
    - Turai detects magic and finds out its magic weed

- Can select 8 races to prosper
    - But 12 icons ...
    - Age is all about positioning yourself to have the $power$ to be in the ritual

- Ask when the ritual is
    - Within a [elf] lifetime

- Internal State:
    - Supports Elf Queen, wants the ritual to proceed so elves will deffo be a big power in the next age
    - Will stay w/ Egg to protect it so we can sacrifice it

- I have a dream
    - From GGG
    - I see a passage hidden in a forest
    - That leads to a dragon.

    - A gold dragon is pearched on a giant horde of treasure
    - At the foot of the horde, the egg is eating everything

    - When I awaken, I realized
    - the silvery purpley of the leaves means that that forest
    - is probably the one we're in right now

    - I should ask a local ranger if any dragons are in the wood
    - I do that.
        - I get a marked map

- Entilzha, Squood, and Turai take the egg to the cave.
    - Solon is doing research on the egg & the Three, also ends up w/ directions to our cave
        - Grabs Yorden 

- At the cave...
    - Cave is a crack in the cliffside
    - Enterance seems unused, ALMOST too small for a dragon to fit...

    - Turai notices nothing has used this passage.
    - Entilzha seals cave enterance against demons and undead.

    - Small treasure pile
    - Gold dragon sitting apon the pile
    - Some light coming down from a hole in the ceiling, where the dragon probs enters/exits
        - Turai determines this dragon has been asleep for some time.

    - Entilzha approached the dragon, revealing the horn to it
    - Unfortunately, the horde is actually DREAM DRUGZ

    - Nightmare time!

    - Dream of an ogre running away from some human riders
        - Minotaurs, lamisu
        - Also an ogre mage knight

    - As the last enemy dies, we each imagine clawing it down with our claws
    - The dream has a LARGE VOICE: "I know not how you came into this dream, but if you help me slay my demons & traumas, the reward to you will be great. My name is Zephalarius, and I have been trapped in sleep too long. Help me quell an old foe next; a green dragon, who for many centuries has chased after me. If you can change the memory to diplomacy, it'd be gr8."

- Find some green psuedo-dragons at a waterfall
    - Large green dragon looks at us from atop

    - Rivalry between the gold & green dragons started over a lover
        - (psychic shit)
        - Evil sorcerer Leffen cursed both dragons
        - This is the first time they've seen each other since the sorcerer died & curse lifted
