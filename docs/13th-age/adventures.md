        - No, map to a structure inside his capital, dorf king already HAS the treasure!

- We arrive in Axis to take on supplies for the final leg of our journey to Forge
    - Axis built on a volcano
    - Lots of soldiers

    - Krinly talks to them in another language
    - Centaur is surprised!

        - Centaur is super mad

- Dr. Rorak wrote his thesis on the demontouched (tieflings)
    - In 12th age, tieflings existed w/ minimal stigma
    - In 13th age, they aligned w/ diabolist & were wiped out by everyone else
    - Doesn't know why they aligned w/ diabolist, suspects it was coincidence of where they were @ start of age
    - Some w/ more exotic skin colours in Drakkenhall
